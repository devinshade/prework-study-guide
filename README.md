# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, this webpage is designed to help me study the course work and motivate me by providing random suggestions on what to study first. Building this webpage taught me the foundations of writing HTML to create the stucture, CSS to style the content, JavaScript for interactivity in the console, and Git for version control.

## Installation

N/A

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

This wepage is seperated into 4 areas of study; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains notes about the given topic and, if we open the DevTools consol, we can see the JavaScript running. To open Chrome DevTools, press Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser and will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for me to study first.
